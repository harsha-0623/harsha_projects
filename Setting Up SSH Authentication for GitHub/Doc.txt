**Setting Up SSH Authentication for GitHub**

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up SSH authentication for GitHub while keeping existing SSH keys intact.

---

### **1. Generate a New SSH Key**
To create a new SSH key without overwriting existing keys, run:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_github
```
If `ed25519` is not supported, use:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_github
```
- Use `id_github` as the filename to distinguish it from any existing SSH keys.
- Set a passphrase if needed.

---

### **2. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**
Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
Then, add the new key:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_github
```
Verify the key has been added:
```bash
ssh-add -l
```

---

### **3. Add the Public Key to GitHub**
Copy the public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_github.pub
```
- Go to **GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys**
- Click **New SSH Key**
- Paste the key, name it appropriately (e.g., "Laptop SSH Key"), and save.

---

### **4. Configure SSH to Use the New Key for GitHub**
Edit (or create) the SSH configuration file:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```
Save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

---

### **5. Test the SSH Connection**
Run the following command to ensure authentication is successful:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, it should return:
```
Hi <your-username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
If you encounter issues, use verbose mode for debugging:
```bash
ssh -vT git@github.com
```

---

### **6. Update Git Remote to Use SSH**
Check the current remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```
If it uses HTTPS, switch it to SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/your-repository.git
```
Now, try pushing to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

---

This completes the SSH setup for GitHub while keeping existing SSH keys intact. ðŸš€
